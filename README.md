Courersa-DataScience-GettingAndCleaningData-Project

This project is to read data from an archive of motion data acquired by a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  The full data is downloaded and unzipped from the archive.  Then the test data, training data, subject, features, and activity are all merged together into a tidy dataset.  The resulting data is the mean of the mean and standard deviation of each motion measurement for each subject/activity combination. 


To create the tide data:
(1) make a working directory
(2) under the working directory, make directories called code and data.
(3) run run_analysis.R with working directory set to code.
