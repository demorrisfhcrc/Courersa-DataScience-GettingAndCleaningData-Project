This project analyzes the set described in the Readme.md file.

The stored information on that data describes the data as follows:

=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

================

For each signal described above, the stored database included mean & std of the signals as well as numerous other variables describing the distribution.

This tidy dataset only uses the mean and std of each signal.  The mean of the mean and std are calculated for each unique subject/activity in the dataset.

The tidy dataset has 4 initial columns:
(1) "set" - describes whether the data was allocated to the "test" dataset or the "training" data set.
(2) "subject" - is a unique numeric id 1-30 for all the subjects on which we have data.
(3 & 4) "classlabel"/"activity" - describe the activity during the measurements.  This is one of: "WALKING","WALKING UPSTAIRS","WALKING DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING"
(remaining columns) - mean of mean or mean of std for all the measurement for each unique subject/activity
